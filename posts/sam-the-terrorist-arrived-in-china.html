	<span class="post-date">Sun 13 February 2011</span>
	<p>It has been some days I guess since I have been away from Hollad. But it has been kind of hectic. I will start
from the trip till today. </p>
<p>The trip started early at 6:30, train to Schiphol and than flight to
London, wait in London for 5 hours. So I was waiting and got little
bored and decided to walk around for a bit and sit at some other places,
and watch some episodes on my laptop. Than when I saw I could check in
for my flight to Beijing I noticed I forgot my jacket somewhere, so I
went to look for it at the places I went before. Because this jacket is
my 4-5 year old favorite jacket :D</p>
<p>Then I found it after 10 minutes of searching and thought ah great just
get it. Than I noticed there were more securtiy than normally around me.
I thought hmm just walk away and at that moment one of them talked to
me, asking me if it was my jacket. What is in your pocket? Why did you
leave your jacket? What is the flashing light in the jacket? (My bike
light, but forgot i took that with me haha)What is your destination?
What is your intention? What will you do in beijing? And he kept
complaining it was really not good to leave something... he asked me
more questions but can't remember all of them.</p>
<p>After a little trouble I arrived in Beijing, took some subway to get to
the hotel and meet Marry again :D was really good. We stayed in a hotel
for 2 days while searching for appartments. Some of the appartments were
so bad haha, with toilets which looked like they weren't cleaned for
weeks, but we finally found one for a decent price. A 2 bedroom
appartement with a living room, and kitchen for 400 euro a month. House
prices are quite high here in Beijing compared to Xiamen. To buy a house
also costs like 200.000 euro or more for 60-80m2.</p>
<p>There has also been some snow really fun, because it was Marrys first
time to see snow in her whole life. Had some lil snowfights etc hehe :D
Too bad didn't make pictures yet, will try to make more. We got a camera
just forget to take it...</p>
<p>Edit: Made some pics of the appartment, you can see them
