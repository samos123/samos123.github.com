You want private cloud inside public cloud for additional security,
improved agility, lower opex and ultimate flexibility? I present you
OpenStack running on Google Compute Engine (GCE). I hope you got the
joke, if not, let me explain there are no benefits to running OpenStack
on GCP. OpenStack on GCP is meant for testing
purposes only and this doesn't make sense for a real scenario.

In this blog post, you will learn how to utilize [nested KVM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances)
inside GCP to deploy an OpenStack environment. The use case of why I did this was
for testing the OpenStack K8s Cloud Provider with K8s.

The guide is split up in the following sections:

1. Creating the GCE VM with nested KVM enabled
2. Deploying OpenStack using OpenStack Ansible with all in one(aio) node mode
3. Accessing the environment

### 1. Creating the GCE VMs with nested KVM enbaled

Let's create a VM called `openstack-1` with 32 vCPUs. This VM will be used to run additional VMs
that are spawned by OpenStack. The GCE VM itself will run the OpenStack control plane and serve
as an OpenStack compute node. In this section you will create 2 Ubuntu 20.04 VMs

```bash
gcloud compute disks create ubuntu2004disk \
  --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud --image-family ubuntu-2004-lts \
  --zone us-central1-a

gcloud compute images create ubuntu-2004-nested \
  --source-disk ubuntu2004disk --source-disk-zone us-central1-a \
  --licenses "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/vm-options/global/licenses/enable-vmx"

gcloud compute instances create openstack-1 --zone us-central1-a \
              --image ubuntu-2004-nested \
              --boot-disk-size 600G \
              --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
              --can-ip-forward \
              --network default \
              --tags http-server,https-server,novnc,openstack-apis \
              --min-cpu-platform "Intel Haswell" \
              --machine-type n1-standard-32
```

Now verify that nested KVM is enabled:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh openstack-1 --zone us-central1-a
sudo -i
apt-get update && apt-get install qemu-kvm -y
kvm-ok
```
The output of kvm-ok should show the following:
```
kvm-ok
# Output should look like below
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```


### 2. Deploying OpenStack
Now let's deploy OpenStack using OpenStack Ansible with all in one(aio) mode.
Ensure you're still SSHed into the `openstack-1` VM, if not run:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh openstack-1 --zone us-central1-a
sudo -i
```

Start a screen or tmux session because deploying OpenStack can take 30 min to 
2 hours. Run the following command:
```bash
screen
```


Clone openstack-ansible repo to openstack-1:
```bash
git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-ansible \
    /opt/openstack-ansible
cd /opt/openstack-ansible
git checkout stable/ussuri
```

Install Ansible on the VM and install all the required Ansible roles:
```bash
scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh
```

Bootstrap the AIO configuration for openstack ansible
```bash
export SCENARIO='aio_lxc_barbican_octavia'
scripts/bootstrap-aio.sh
```

Create the LXC containers that run the different OpenStack components
and install OpenStack:
```bash
openstack-ansible playbooks/setup-hosts.yml \
    playbooks/setup-infrastructure.yml \
    playbooks/setup-openstack.yml
```

Now OpenStack should have been succesfully deployed on the openstack-1 VM.

### 3. Accessing the environment
The environment is currently only exposed on the internal IP address. The
floating IP range is also only routable within the `openstack-1` VM. So
let's setup a tunnel to the `openstack-1` VM to be able to access the
newly deployed environment. One way to create a tunnel is to use sshuttle.

On your local machine (laptop, desktop etc), run the following commands
to setup the tunnel with sshuttle:
```bash
PUBLIC_IP=$(gcloud compute instances describe openstack-1 --zone us-central1-a \
         --format='get(networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)')
# note that you may need to add your public SSH key in GCP
sshuttle -r sam@$PUBLIC_IP 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16
```
Now you should be able to access the web UI on the private VPC IP address
of your VM. Get the private address of your `openstack-1` VM with the
following command:
```bash
gcloud compute instances describe openstack-1 --zone us-central1-a \
         --format='get(networkInterfaces[0].networkIP)'
```

In your browser go to `https://$PRIVATE_IP` and you should be able to
see the Horizon UI.
