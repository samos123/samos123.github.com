Title: About Me
Author: Sam Stoelinga
Slug: about.html

Hello, I'm Sam Stoelinga, a passionate Open Source advocate and contributor.
I've contributed to open source projects such as OpenStack and Kaniko.
I'm the creator of [https://websu.io](https://websu.io), which is an open source
project to help improve the speed of your websites. 

My day job at Google Cloud is to help customers with adopting GCP, specifically focusing
on K8s, Istio and other related technologies. This allows me to help customers with solving
their challenging use cases and problems. This blog helps documenting solutions I provide
to customers.

In my free time I enjoy soccer, skateboarding, working on open source and taking
my kid out to the beach.

I'm trying to become a better public speaker by publicly speaking. See some appearances here:
