Title: About Me
Author: Sam Stoelinga
Slug: about

Hello, I'm Sam Stoelinga, a passionate Open Source advocate and contributor.
I've contributed to open source projects such as OpenStack and Kaniko.
I'm the creator of [https://websu.io](https://websu.io) and [bgdestroyer.com](https://www.bgdestroyer.com).
Need some help? That's possible, you can [hire me](/pages/hire-me.html) as consultant.

My day job at Google Cloud is to help customers with adopting GCP, specifically focusing
on K8s, Istio and other related technologies. This allows me to help customers with solving
their challenging use cases and problems. Opinions and solutions provided are provided by
me as an individual and do not represent my employer.

In my free time I enjoy soccer, skateboarding, working on open source and playing things

I'm trying to become a better public speaker by publicly speaking. See some appearances here:
