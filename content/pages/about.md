Slug: about

I'm Sam Stoelinga, a passionate Open Source contributor focusing on cloud, K8s and ML platforms.
I've contributed to open source projects such as Weaviate, K8s, OpenStack and Kaniko.

I'm the creator or co-creator of the following OSS projects:

* [substratusai/lingo](https://github.com/substratusai/lingo) - Lightweight ML Proxy & autoscaler for K8s
* [Websu.io](https://websu.io): website performance check as a service
* [bgdestroyer.com](https://www.bgdestroyer.com)

Need some help? Feel free to DM me anytime on LinkedIn.

My day job at Google Cloud is to help customers with K8s and ML Platforms.
This blog only contains my personal opinion.

I'm trying to become a better public speaker by publicly speaking. See some appearances here:
