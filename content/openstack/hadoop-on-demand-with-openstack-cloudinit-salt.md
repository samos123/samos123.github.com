This post will describe the whole process of providing hadoop on demand
through Openstack, Cloudinit and Saltstack. We will use Openstack
to provision servers on demand, cloudconfig to install salt-master and
salt-minion and saltstack to deploy hadoop namenode and datanodes, all fully
automated. This makes us able to deploy a 5-100+ node (still need to test 20+) Hadoop HDFS
cluster within 5 minutes.

## Deploy salt-master with Cloudconfig
We will install and configure salt-master to
auto\_accept key files from the minions. Please note
that this is a security risk.

Create the following master-cloudconfig file:

    :::yaml
    #cloud-config
    apt_mirror: http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/

    apt_sources:
     - source: "ppa:saltstack/salt"

    packages:
     - python-software-properties
     - salt-master
     - git

    runcmd:
     - bash /tmp/bootstrap-master.sh

    write_files
     - content: |
            #!/bin/bash
            sed -i 's/^#auto_accept.*$/auto_accept: True/g' /etc/salt/master
            sudo service salt-master restart
       path: /tmp/bootstrap-master.sh
       permissions: "0755"


Now launch openstack instance with: `nova boot --name salt-master --image ubuntu_14.04 --user-data master-cloudconfig --flavor m1.medium --key-name sam`.
The salt-master that we launched in our case has as ip 192.168.111.66. You can ssh to this machine via ssh ubuntu@192.168.111.66


## Configuring the salt master to deploy a hadoop cluster
In order to be able to deploy hadoop on the salt-master we are going to
manually configure the salt-master with the official hadoop formula.
We could also automate this via cloudconfig, but for sake of demonstration
I'm going to list the manual steps here.

### Configuring salt to use hadoop-formula and it's dependencies
We are going to use the following formula: [Hadoop formula](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/hadoop-formula), which
has as dependencies the [hostsfile-formula](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/hostsfile-formula) and the
[sun-java-formula](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/sun-java-formula).
The hostsfile formula is to make all nodes accessible by their hostname/fqdn and
the sun-java-formula lets you automatically install java from oracle.

    :::bash
    ssh ubuntu@192.168.111.66 # SSH into your salt-master
    sudo mkdir /srv/salt
    sudo mkdir /srv/salt/formulas
    sudo "cd /srv/salt/formulas && 
          git clone https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/hadoop-formula
          git clone https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/hostsfile-formula &&
          git clone https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/sun-java-formula"
    
    cat << EOF > /etc/salt/master.d/file_roots.conf
    file_roots:
      base:
        - /srv/salt
        - /srv/salt/formulas/hadoop-formula
        - /srv/salt/formulas/hostsfile-formula
        - /srv/salt/formulas/sun-java-formula
    EOF

    cat << EOF > /etc/salt/master.d/pillar_roots.conf
    pillar_roots:
      base:
        - /srv/pillar
    EOF

    sudo service salt-master restart


### Creating SSH keypairs for hadoop-formula

    :::bash
    cd /srv/salt/formulas/hadoop-formula/hadoop/files && ./generate-keypairs.sh


### Configuring the top.sls state file to include hadoop and deps

On the salt-master create the following file /srv/salt/top.sls:

    :::yaml
    base:
      'G@roles:hadoop_slave or G@roles:hadoop_master':
        - match: compound
        - hostsfile
        - hostsfile.hostname
        - sun-java
        - sun-java.env
        - hadoop
        - hadoop.hdfs

By using [pillar](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/pillar/) we can also change the parameters of hadoop.
You can check all available parameters that are change-able here: 
[hadoop-pillar.example](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/hadoop-formula/blob/master/pillar.example).

Create the following top.sls pillar file /srv/pillar/top.sls:

    :::yaml
    base:
      'G@roles:hadoop_slave or G@roles:hadoop_master':
         - hadoop

and the following hadoop specific pillar file /srv/pillar/hadoop.sls:

    :::yaml
    hadoop:
      version: hdp-2.2.0 # ['apache-1.2.1', 'apache-2.2.0', 'hdp-1.3.0', 'hdp-2.2.0', 'cdh-4.5.0', 'cdh-4.5.0-mr1']
      users:
        hadoop: 6000
        hdfs: 6001


## Deploy salt-minions as hadoop nodes
Now that we have configured our salt-master we can start
deploying the salt-minions which will either server as hadoop-master(namenode)
or as hadoop-slave(datanode).

### Launching hadoop-master(namenode) nodes
First create our cloudconfig file used by openstack hadoopmaster-cloudconfig:

    :::yaml
    #cloud-config
    apt_mirror: "http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/"
    apt_sources: 
      - source: "ppa:saltstack/salt"
    packages: 
      - python-software-properties
      - salt-minion

    runcmd: 
     - bash /tmp/bootstrap-minion.sh

    write_files: 
      - content: |
             roles:
                - hadoop_master
        path: /etc/salt/grains
      - content: |
            #!/bin/bash
            sed -i 's/^#master.*$/master: 192.168.111.66/g' /etc/salt/minion
            sudo service salt-minion restart
        path: /tmp/bootstrap-minion.sh
        permissions: "0755"
      - content: |
            mine_functions:
                network.interfaces: []
                network.ip_addrs: []
                grains.items: []
        path: /etc/salt/minion.d/mine_functions.conf

Then create a new instance using openstack:
`nova boot --name hadoop-master-1 --image ubuntu_14.04 --user-data hadoopmaster-cloudconfig --flavor m1.medium --key-name sam`

### Deploying hadoop-slave(datanode) nodes
Create a hadoopslave-cloudconfig:

    :::yaml
    #cloud-config
    apt_mirror: "http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/"
    apt_sources: 
      - source: "ppa:saltstack/salt"
    packages: 
      - python-software-properties
      - salt-minion

    runcmd: 
     - bash /tmp/bootstrap-minion.sh

    write_files: 
      - content: |
             roles:
                - hadoop_slave
        path: /etc/salt/grains
      - content: |
            #!/bin/bash
            sed -i 's/^#master.*$/master: 192.168.111.66/g' /etc/salt/minion
            sudo service salt-minion restart
        path: /tmp/bootstrap-minion.sh
        permissions: "0755"
      - content: |
            mine_functions:
                network.interfaces: []
                network.ip_addrs: []
                grains.items: []
        path: /etc/salt/minion.d/mine_functions.conf

Now launch 10 hadoop-slave nodes
`nova boot --name hadoop-slave --num-instances 10 --image ubuntu_14.04 --user-data hadoopslave-cloudconfig --flavor m1.medium --key-name sam`

### Let saltstack deploy hadoop
First make sure that the salt-master detected all our hadoop-master and hadoop-slave nodes. Execute the following comand: `salt '*' managed.up`
it should show your 11 nodes.

If all nodes are up and detected you can start deployment of hadoop with the following command:

    :::bash
    salt '*' state.highstate


## Accessing the hadoop HDFS cluster
After hadoop has been successfully deployed you can go to http://{hadoop\_masterip}:50070 and check that
10 live nodes are active.

Now you can login to any of the nodes and save files to hdfs like this:

    :::bash
    sudo -u hdfs -i
    hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hdfs"
    hadoop fs -put /tmp/bootstrap-minion.sh /user/hdfs/test.sh


Hope this tutorial was useful! 

Notes: You can also configure
[salt-minion directly through cloudconfig](https://github.com/number5/cloud-init/blob/master/doc/examples/cloud-config-salt-minion.txt) instead.
